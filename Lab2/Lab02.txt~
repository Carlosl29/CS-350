1.     [6 = 3*2 points]  Hex AF₁₆ = 1010 1111₂ = 175₁₀ unsigned.  What decimal value
       	    		 does AF₁₆ represent in (a) sign-magnitude; (b) 1’s complement;
			 (c) 2’s complement?

			 a.)-0101111 => -47
			 b.)01010000 => 80
			 c.)01010001 => 81
			 
2.     [6 = 3*2 points] Show the results of each of the following steps: (a) Convert
       	    		3B5D₁₆ to binary. (b)Then take the 2's complement negative.
			(c) Then convert back to hex. (Hint: Your answer to part (c)
			should equal the 16's complement of our starting hex number.)

			a.)0011 1011 0101 1101
			b.)1100 0100 1010 0011
			c.)C4A3


3.     [4 = 2*2 points] (a) What hex string represents 0110 0001 0011 0011₂ ?  (b) What
       	    		sequence of two ASCII characters represents the same bitstring?

			a.)61 33
			b.)a  3
			
4.     [4 = 2*2 points]  Let hex BED0 0000 represent an IEEE 32-bit floating-point number
       	    		 *.  (a) What binary scientific notation value does it represent?
			 (b) What decimal value does it represent?  (You can write the
			 answer in fractional or decimal form, your choice.  Also, feel
			 free to abbreviate long strings of 0s or 1s: E.g. you can write 0
			 (12) to indicate 12 zero bits.)

			 a.)-1.1010(20)*2^-2
			 b.)

5.     [4 = 2*2 points]  (a) Give the result of converting decimal 543/64 to normalized
       	    		 binary scientific notation†.  (b) Convert the result from part
			 (a) to 32-bit IEEE floating-point format and give the result.
			 
6.     [2 points]  Let X = 11.0(21)11₂. Note X has too many significant digits to be
       	  	   represented exactly as a 32-bit IEEE floating-point number. What
		   are the two binary numbers closest to X that we *can* represent?
		   
7.     [4 = 2*2 points]  (a) Calculate 1.0000×2⁵ + 1.0000×2⁵ to 5 significant digits.
       	    		 Also, say if there was any truncation of 1 bits as you did this.
			 (b) Repeat part (a) on 1.0000×2⁵ + 1.0000×2⁰.
