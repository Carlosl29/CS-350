1.     [1 pt]	Read as an unsigned binary number, 110111 represents what decimal value?
       	  	>55
      
2.     [3 pts]  Let V be the decimal value from Problem 1; what is the 7-bit representation 
       	  	of -V in (a) sign-magnitude, (b)1's complement, and (c)2's complement? (Add a
		sign bit and possibly modify the 6 bits inherited from problem
		a.)1110111
		b.)1001000
		c.)1001001

3.     [3 pts] Reading 110111 as a signed 6-bit value, what are the bitstring and decimal
       	       representations of -(110111) in (a)sign-magnitude, (b)1's complement, and (c)
	       2's complement?
	       a.)001000 => 8_10
	       b.)
	       
4.     [6 = 3*2 pts] What is the bitstring and decimal value for the most negative 6-bit
       	    	     number in (a)sign-magnitude, (b)1's complement, and (c)2's complement?
		     a.)111111 => -31
		     b.)100000 => -31
		     c.)100001 => -32

5.     [6 = 3*2 pts] What is the bitstring and decimal value for the most negative n-bit
       	    	     number in (a)sign-magnitude, (b)1's complement, and (c)2's complement?
		     a.)1^(n)...  => -(2^n)
		     b.)10^(n)... => -(2^n)
		     c.)10^(n-1)...1 => (2^(n) - 1) 
		     
6.     [4 pts]  Which of the three systems have two forms of zero ("positive" and 
       	  	"negative" zero), and how do you write them in each of those systems?
		Sign-Magnitude ==> 000...00 = +0, 111...11 = -0
		1's Complement ==> 000...00 = +0, 111...11 = -0
		
7.     [2 pts]  In which (if any) of the three systems does taking the negative of the most 
       	  	negative number cause overflow?  What about the negative of the most positive
		number?
		In 2'complement taking the negative of the most negative causes overflow.
		Taking the negative of the most positive doesn't cause overflow.
		
8.     [2 pts] What is 111011 + 001110, using unsigned addition?  Does overflow occur?
       	       111011 => 32+16+8+2+1 = 59
	      +0001110 => 8+4+2 = 14
	      1001001 => 64+8+1 = 73
	      Overflow does not occur
	      
9.     [2 pts] What is 111000 â€“ 001101, using unsigned subtraction?
       	       111000
	      -001101
	       101011
